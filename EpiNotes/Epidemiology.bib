  annote = {Well it's a little bit lazy, and a little bit satisfied. It's grasping around for a causal approach but not getting there.

Good point about needing otherwise comparable exposed and non exposed: uses the in-Scotland association of water quality vs SMR for cardiac disease (not impressive across the tenfold range of water hardness), compared to the UK effect (looks inverse across the 40 fold range, and maybe across the 4-fold range for the rest of the UK). This conveniently ignores the other factors unique - within the study -~ to Scotland.

This leads to the good statement that you can't find the effect of a cause that is either universal or absent, using association; and you will need very large numbers to find the effect of a cause that is tightly distributed, relative to its possible range, in the sample under study. There will simply be few high-leverage points.

It also leads to the bad statement that you can conclude things about the effect of risks entirely present in one population and entirely absent in another, still using association.

"The determinants of incidence [in populations] are not necessarily the same as the causes of cases [in one versus another individual]"}

We provide an introduction to these developments and their use in epidemiologic research. Causal diagrams can provide a starting point for identifying variables that must be measured and controlled to obtain unconfounded effect estimates. They also provide a method for critical evaluation of traditional epidemiologic criteria for confounding. In particular, they reveal certain heretofore unnoticed shortcomings of those criteria when used in considering multiple potential confounders. We show how to modify the traditional criteria to correct those shortcomings.},

  title = {Beyond Subjective and Objective in Statistics},
  issn = {1467-985X},
  abstract = {Decisions in statistical data analysis are often justified, criticized or avoided by using concepts of objectivity and subjectivity. We argue that the words `objective' and `subjective' in statistics discourse are used in a mostly unhelpful way, and we propose to replace each of them with broader collections of attributes, with objectivity replaced by transparency, consensus, impartiality and correspondence to observable reality, and subjectivity replaced by awareness of multiple perspectives and context dependence. Together with stability, these make up a collection of virtues that we think is helpful in discussions of statistical foundations and practice. The advantage of these reformulations is that the replacement terms do not oppose each other and that they give more specific guidance about what statistical science strives to achieve. Instead of debating over whether a given statistical method is subjective or objective (or normatively debating the relative merits of subjectivity and objectivity in statistical practice), we can recognize desirable attributes such as transparency and acknowledgement of multiple perspectives as complementary goals. We demonstrate the implications of our proposal with recent applied examples from pharmacology, election polling and socio-economic stratification. The aim of the paper is to push users and developers of statistical methods towards more effective use of diverse sources of information and more open acknowledgement of assumptions and goals.},
