  annote = {Well it's a little bit lazy, and a little bit satisfied. It's grasping around for a causal approach but not getting there.

Good point about needing otherwise comparable exposed and non exposed: uses the in-Scotland association of water quality vs SMR for cardiac disease (not impressive across the tenfold range of water hardness), compared to the UK effect (looks inverse across the 40 fold range, and maybe across the 4-fold range for the rest of the UK). This conveniently ignores the other factors unique - within the study -~ to Scotland.

This leads to the good statement that you can't find the effect of a cause that is either universal or absent, using association; and you will need very large numbers to find the effect of a cause that is tightly distributed, relative to its possible range, in the sample under study. There will simply be few high-leverage points.

It also leads to the bad statement that you can conclude things about the effect of risks entirely present in one population and entirely absent in another, still using association.

"The determinants of incidence [in populations] are not necessarily the same as the causes of cases [in one versus another individual]"}
